    \subsection{Program Counter}{
        The Program Counter contains the address of the instruction to be executed.
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=100mm, scale =1]{pc.png}
        \end{center}
        The program counter is usually incremented by four because each instruction is 32 bits. When the 
        clock edge is 1, the input address becomes the output address. 
    }\label{sub:sub1}%


    \subsection{Branch}{
        The branch instruction adds PC+8 with a 24-bit immediate. RegSrc is 1 so that the multiplexer
        selects R15, which contains the program counter. The immediate is extended by four and extended and
        added to R15. The Aluresult is fed into the PC, so that the program counter is changed.

    \subsection{Carry Lookahead Adder}{
        I implemented the carry-lookahead adder. I generated the propogate and generate using a for loop in C. 
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale = 1]{propogate.png}
        \end{center}
        
        \center I used the propogate and generate values to find the carry values.
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[scale =1]{carry_look.png}
        \end{center}
        
        My ripple carry adder works also.

    \subsection{Testing}{
        I tested my design with the given testcases.
